## Intro

In this project, I'm going to predict the price of Amsterdam's accommodations in AirBnb based on his characteristics. For that, I build predictive models of Machine Learning for train and test the data, calculate the RMSE (root-mean-square error) and make predictions.

The goal for this project was a competition in Kaggle organizated by Ironhack School and where I got the 1st position.

## Data

- `train.csv` is the dataset with all the data about accomodations in Amsterdam, his features and his price at that moment. This is the dataset that I use for train.
- `test.csv` is the dataset with more data about accomodations in Amsterdam but without the price information and this is the value that I'm going to predict. This is the dataset that I use for test.
- `sample.csv` is the dataset where I fill my predictions of the price.
- `predictions.csv` is the `sample.csv` dataset filled.
